Trakkkr is a site to help you track the orice of your product on Jumia. It is built with Reactjs and Nodejs(Olamidun Kolapo). At the client side, I use Redux to manage the state of the users and the product.

You can run the code by installing all dependences, "npm install".
Run the code on the terminal, "npm start".
